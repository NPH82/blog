##Wireframes.
Time to begin wireframing my project, but which service do I use?  I had heard of [Marvel App](https://marvelapp.com/) and [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), but for some reason [MockFlow](https://www.mockflow.com/) seemed to speak to me.  I don't really know why? It must have been a combination of never seeing it in action before, and their landing page making the process look simple.  Reflecting on it now, Marvel App uses a React framework, that should have been my first choice. Oh well, I digress.  I actually really enjoyed creating the wireframe on MockFlow.

##Getting Started
I wasn't sure where to begin.  I knew I was making a web application, but it was going to be primarily used on a mobile device. I started by using a template for the iPhone and inserted the web browser inside.  Now I was going places.  Time to start the landing page.  I began by grabbing the elements from the sidebar, and dragged them over to place them.  It was pretty quick and easy, all I needed was a couple of inputs, some labels, a tiny bit of text and a button.  MockFlow helps with aligning elements which made the process painless.

##The Rest of the Process
After completing the login, I planned the rest of the app and moved on to creating an account page, and a form page.  The account page was similar to the login, and the form page only added a few extra input elements and a select element.  The hardest part was deciding on the color of the button and background color for the application.

##The Only Hiccup
The one issue I had, which falls under the beggars can't be choosers category, is once three pages are complete, the free trial is over.  This presented a new obstacle.  I decided to focus my energy on the pages which were going to be most difficult to describe to my team mates.  This meant scrapping the login page which was the most basic of the pages, and focusing on the administration side of the application.

##Administration Pages
With the Administration pages, I needed to have a navbar.  I then planned out the pages necessary for the rest of the application.  This consisted of a archived page, mainly links of collected reports.  A recent page, where reports within the past 24 hours would be recorded.  Lastly a map page, this is where the Google Map would be appearing to show the reported data markers.  These were all pretty simple pages to create, and once I had the understanding of the basic look and design I was trying to implement it made creating my first wireframe project very easy.
